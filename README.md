# Jira Dark Theme

> Jira doesn't have dark mode in 2022.

## Description

Very simple Chrome extension that applies 10 lines of css to Jira resulting in a very hacky dark mode.

## Installation

Download the code or clone the repo, activate developer mode in `chrome://extensions`,
and load the extension using `Load unpacked extension`.


## Disclaimer

Will never be published to Chrome store.

This looks somewhat accessible to me but I am not a designer. Please feel free to improve and contribute in any way you know how.
